Description:
Low poly ak 74 u rifle. Perfect for use in games or mods.
The mesh has more modeled details, it's suitable for animating beacouse it has the buttstock and the magazine as separate objects.
Also I have use smoothing groups for better results for rounded areas, as this is a low poly model and I couldn't use mesh smooth.
It has a crappy texture job, but it does quite good in games like Gta: San Andreas.
